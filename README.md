# JavaScriptPracticeMan 

Welcome to my JavaScript practice space

This repository is where I explore and practice JavaScript as I continue my learning journey. Whether it's mastering the basics, working through challenges, or building small hands-on projects — this is where I try, break, fix, and grow.

## What You'll Find Here

- Practice code for various JavaScript concepts (functions, arrays, objects)
- Mini-projects and experiments
- A fully functional **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** app — one of my biggest learning milestones so far
- DOM manipulation, browser events, and more

## Why This Repo?

I'm currently learning JavaScript and using this repo to:
- Reinforce what I learn by practicing it
- Build hands-on projects like the CRUD app to understand real-world logic
- Track my progress over time
- Share my learning journey publicly

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- HTML & CSS (for front-end structure and styling)
- Browser DevTools

## CRUD App

One of the key projects in this repo is a **CRUD application**, where users can:
- Create new items
- View (Read) existing entries
- Edit (Update) entries
- Delete items

[View The CRUD Application Folder](https://github.com/Maaaann/JavaScriptPracticeMan/tree/main/CRUDS_APP)


This app helped me practice:
- Working with arrays and objects
- Event handling
- DOM manipulation
- Data flow logic
